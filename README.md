# Sweet4x4 REV02

[Manual on how to assemble can be found here](https://fri3dcamp.github.io/badge_2024/sweet4x4/) Revision `02` no longer requires the Fri3d badge but instead relies solely on the us of a [TNY, QT Py or XIAO board](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-qt-py). For future workshops we plan to use the [LANA TNY](https://phyx.be/LANA_TNY/). The workshop during [Fri3d Camp](https://fri3d.be/) will be done with a XIAO RP2040. 


## Firmare
LANA_TNY firmware is still underway.
For the Fri3d Camp workshop we opted for RP2040. An example using [KMK](https://kmkfw.io/) can be found in this repository.

There is an issue with the LEDs, when pushed too far in the footprint they tend to break. In order to prevent damaging the LEDs we sugges mounting only 6 on the bottom and use them for underglow.

# Fri3d_Sweet4x4 REV01

## About
The progress and more details about this project can be found on [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/186574-sweet-4x4)

This PCB has, besides the required layout for a 4x4 keypad, some nifty features which will help during assembly and maintenance. The left most corner contains a diode bending corner, making sure that your diodes have their leads bent in the right spot will help during assembly. The other useful feature if a built in lube station. The X cutout will snugly fit a stem whilst the rectangular hole will  fit the body the switch you're cleaning.

## Getting started
### Using the Fri3d Camp 2022 badge
The Fri3d Badge has an ESP32 on board, because of the chip the badge uses we can only create a 4x4 Bluetooth keyboard.
1. Make sure you have Arduino IDE installed
2. Add the ESP32 board to the Arduino board manager, I think this link works well : https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/
3. Add the libraries you need
  - BLEKeyboard : https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard
  - Keypad : https://github.com/Chris--A/Keypad
  - Badge2020 : https://github.com/Fri3dCamp/Badge2020_arduino
  - Neopixel : https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel
4. Open the Sweet_4x4_minimal.ino code in the Arduino IDE, this only includes code to turn the pcb + badge into a BLE keyboard (not using screen or RGB leds)
5. Optionally you can use the Sweet_4x4_full.ino code, this also include some basic code to get the TFT screen to work

### Using a XIAO module
This allows to use the 4x4 PCB as a HID device over USB-C
